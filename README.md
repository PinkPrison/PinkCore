# API

### :exclamation: API Includes the following:

- An easier way to send actionbars and (sub)titles to players :tulip:

- Easy ways to create Items and Skulls primarily for GUI's :skull:

- Implements TriumpTeams Gui-System for easy use :eagle:

# CORE

### :exclamation: CORE Includes the following:

- Listeners to disable Weather events, Explosions and some World events ðŸ’¥

- Functionality for cancelling crafting and placing of certain Items and Blocks :x:

- A Listener that (Hopefully) should fix a minecraft bug that lets players damage more than normal :heart:

- A fully functional CommandBlocker that cancels specified commands (fully configurable) if the sender of the Command is not contained in the config.yml ðŸ‘®

- Auto broadcasting of messages to the server, the messages can even have multiple lines ðŸ¤“

- For auto broadcasting you can also toggle specific messages in the config.yml so the ones specified only will be broadcasted if enabled ðŸ“£
