### :exclamation: CORE Includes the following:

- Listeners to disable Weather events, Explosions and some World events 💥

- Functionality for cancelling crafting and placing of certain Items and Blocks :x:

- A Listener that (Hopefully) should fix a minecraft bug that lets players damage more than normal :heart:

- A fully functional CommandBlocker that cancels specified commands (fully configurable) if the sender of the Command is not contained in the config.yml 👮

- Auto broadcasting of messages to the server, the messages can even have multiple lines 🤓

- For auto broadcasting you can also toggle specific messages in the config.yml so the ones specified only will be broadcasted if enabled 📣
